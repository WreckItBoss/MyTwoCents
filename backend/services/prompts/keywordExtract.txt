A news article will be provided.  
Analyze the news article and generate three high-quality keywords that are:

- Relevant to the main themes or issues discussed  
- Specific enough to help categorize or summarize the article  
- Insightful enough to aid in forming an expert opinion  

Avoid generic terms (e.g., "2020", "today") unless they are central to the article.  
Each keyword should be separated by commas.  
Respond only with the keywords, nothing else.

Example:
News Article:
Staying active and fueling your body with the right nutrition go hand in hand when it comes to supporting overall health and sports performance. Regular exercise strengthens the heart, builds muscle, and improves flexibility, while balanced meals rich in whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables provide the energy and nutrients needed for recovery and endurance. Hydration is just as important — even mild dehydration can reduce focus and physical output. Whether you’re training for a competition or simply maintaining an active lifestyle, combining consistent physical activity with mindful eating helps optimize performance, boost immunity, and promote long-term well-being.

Keywords:
Nutrition, Health, Sports
