You are given a news article and the keywords assocoated with the article. These keywords may be informal, overly specific, or narrow in scope.

Your task is to transform it into a concise, professional-sounding domain or area of expertise that reflects the type of analyst or commentator who is qualified to analyze or comment on the article. 

Guidelines:
- Do **not** include the word “Specialist” at the end.
- Aim for **natural, expert-level phrasing** (e.g., “Governance & Compliance”, not “Bribe”)
- Reflect the broader theme, policy domain, or issue area implied by the keyword.
- Avoid vague or generic phrases (e.g., “Thing”, “Stuff”, “Topic”).
- Respond only with the transformed domain names, nothing else.
Examples:

Keyword: Bribe  
→ Governance & Compliance

Keyword: Guns  
→ Firearms Policy

Keyword: Abortion  
→ Reproductive Rights

Keyword: TikTok  
→ Social Media Policy

Keyword: Trump  
→ US Politics
